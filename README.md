# WorldCupPredictor
This data model was used to predict the 2022 World Cup. Using eigen vector centrality scores. We calculated the national teams with the most players in the top 5 leagues in Europe (Premier, Serie A, Bundesliga, La Liga, and Ligue). To do so, we acquired a world cup database containing all players that will participate in the World Cup.
